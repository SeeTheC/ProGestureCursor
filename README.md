# Abstract

Hand gesture recognition based Human-machine interaction interface is being developed vigorously in recent years because of the great emphasis on easing the Human Computer Interaction. This paper gives an implementation of an application which can be used to control the projected computer screen using hand gestures. The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism to simulate a “Touch Screen Projector”. Different hand gestures will be used to control various computer events (specifically cursor based events) by standing in front of projector. The events may include single click, double click, scrolling etc. The setup of this project includes mounting a web camera near the projector. The web camera will be capturing real time projected images. These images will be processed to recognize hand gestures and corresponding events will be invoked.

Technology: Core Java, JavaCV, OpenCV and C++
